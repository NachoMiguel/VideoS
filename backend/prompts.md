## Full Script Generation Prompts (NEW APPROACH)

### YouTube Transcript to Complete Script Transformation

The new approach generates complete, coherent scripts in a single AI call rather than fragmented bullet points. This ensures better flow, coherence, and narrative structure.

#### Advanced YouTube Content Script Generation
```
I need you to transform this YouTube transcript into a high-retention, engaging script that keeps viewers hooked from start to finish. Here's my specific approach:

CONTENT TRANSFORMATION GOALS:
1. Create a flowing narrative that feels like a compelling story, not a transcript summary
2. Use the transcript as raw material but elevate it with engaging storytelling techniques
3. Target 20,000-30,000 characters for optimal content length
4. Maintain natural, conversational flow throughout

ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES TO INCLUDE:
- Open with a powerful hook that immediately grabs attention
- Use smooth transitions that build anticipation for what's coming next
- Include mysterious or intriguing elements that create curiosity gaps
- Add emotional moments and relatable human experiences
- Use varied sentence lengths and rhythms to maintain interest
- Include strategic pauses and emphasis points for dramatic effect

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
-Introduction: Open with a bold statement or question that immediately pulls viewers in without giving away too much.
-Sections: Break the story into 6-8 sections, each adding new information and keeping the pace fast. Avoid starting each chapter with a repeated intro or reference to the title—just dive straight into the new information.
-Conclusion: Summarize the video’s main points with a thought-provoking or surprising note, encouraging viewers to think about the topic beyond the video.
-Format: Write the script in paragraph form with no “movie director” language. Avoid phrases like “[Cut to shot of…]” or stage directions, and write as though it’s a story told in a straightforward, engaging way

TONE AND STYLE:
- Conversational and engaging, like telling a story to a friend
- Slightly mysterious and intriguing where appropriate
- Authentic and relatable, avoiding robotic or formulaic language
- Dynamic pacing that speeds up and slows down for dramatic effect

TOPICS AND THEMES
-Focus on controversial, shocking, or unknown elements of the subject’s life or career.
-Incorporate recent rumors, controversies, and speculations whenever possible to keep content fresh.
-Highlight the subject’s challenges, untold stories, or conflicts that viewers may not know.

PHRASING, DRAMATIC LANGUAGE, AND CENSORSHIP
-Use powerful, engaging language, like “shocking,” “exposed,” or “revealed,” to hold the viewer’s attention.
-Censor or reword sensitive topics to ensure compliance with YouTube’s guidelines:
-Avoid direct language for terms like “suicide,” “overdose,” or “criminal accusations.”
-Use indirect phrasing (e.g., “off’d himself” for “suicide,” “O.D’d” for “overdose,” “accusations surfaced” for legal issues).
-Ensure any profanity is censored, e.g., “dmn” or “sht.”
-Don’t repeat introductions or start each section with references to the title—just get straight to the point.

CARIED WORDING FOR KEY PHRASES
-Avoid overusing specific phrases or descriptions (e.g., “shocking truth” or “exposed”). Instead, vary the language to keep the script fresh and engaging.
-This ensures the script flows naturally and avoids a formulaic tone.
