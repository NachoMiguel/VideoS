# CUDA Setup Guide for video_editing_app

## **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing cuDNN**

The error shows: `cudnn64_9.dll which is missing`

## **SOLUTION: Install cuDNN 9 for CUDA 12.9**

### **Step 1: Download cuDNN 9**
1. Go to: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
2. Sign in with your NVIDIA account
3. Download **cuDNN v9.x.x for CUDA 12.x**

### **Step 2: Install cuDNN**
1. Extract the downloaded zip file
2. Copy the contents to: `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.9\`
3. This will add the missing `cudnn64_9.dll` and other cuDNN files

### **Step 3: Add to PATH**
Add this to your system PATH:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.9\bin
```

### **Step 4: Test CUDA**
After installing cuDNN, run:
```bash
cd video_editing_app
venv\Scripts\activate
python test_cuda_direct.py
```

## **Current Status:**
✅ CUDA 12.9 installed  
✅ ONNX Runtime 1.22.0 installed  
✅ InsightFace 0.7.3 installed  
❌ **Missing: cuDNN 9**  

## **Expected Result After cuDNN Installation:**
- No more DLL loading errors
- CUDA provider will work
- Face detection will use GPU acceleration
- 2-5x faster performance

## **Alternative: Use CPU (Current Working State)**
If you don't want to install cuDNN, the system currently works with CPU:
- Face detection: ✅ Working
- Performance: Slower but functional
- No additional setup required
